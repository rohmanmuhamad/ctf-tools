# ctf-tools

This is a collection of setup scripts to create an install of various security research tools.
Of course, this isn't a hard problem, but it's really nice to have them in one place that's easily deployable to new machines and so forth.

## Usage

To use, do:

```bash
# set up the path
/path/to/ctf-tools/bin/manage-tools setup
source ~/.bashrc

# list the available tools
manage-tools list

# install gdb, allowing it to try to sudo install dependencies
manage-tools -s install gdb

# install pwntools, but don't let it sudo install dependencies
manage-tools install pwntools

# uninstall gdb
manage-tools uninstall gdb

# uninstall all tools
manage-tools uninstall all
```

Where possible, the tools keep the installs very self-contained (i.e., in to tool/ directory), and most uninstalls are just calls to `git clean` (**NOTE**, this is **NOT** careful; everything under the tool directory, including whatever you were working on, is blown away during an uninstall).
To support python dependencies, however, make sure to create a virtualenv before installing and using tools (i.e., `mkvirtualenv ctf`).

## Adding Tools

To add a tool (say, named *toolname*), do the following:

1. Create a `toolname` directory.
2. Create an `install` script.
3. (optional) if special uninstall steps are reuired, create an `uninstall` script.

### Install Scripts

The install script will be run with `$PWD` being `toolname`. It should install the tool into this directory, in as contained a manner as possible.
Ideally, full uninstallation should be possible with a `git clean`.

The install script should create a `bin` directory and put its executables there.
These executables will be automatically linked into the main `bin` directory for the repo.
They could be launched from any directory, so don't make assumptions about the location of `$0`!
